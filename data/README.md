This is the directory where I will upload the data generated by various scrips, such as the EDA and the data preparation scripts. 

The path to this directory is stored in the **DATA_DIR** constant.

Please note, that 2019-Nov.csv and 2019-Oct.csv should also be here. I have added those to .gitignore to save bandwith. 

You can download them from https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop/download (2GB download for Oct 2019 â€“ Feb 2020)
